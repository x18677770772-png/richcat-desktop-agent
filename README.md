## Overview

> **财听猫 does not replace the LLM. It completes the one layer the LLM cannot reach** — turning screen pixels into structured semantics, and task intent into real operations.

<div align="center">
  <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdceada5-940b-45d1-bf96-2d26df651809" width="100%" controls></video>
</div>

An enterprise's heaviest work does not live inside an LLM API. It lives **on the screen, inside human workflows**:

- **Many surfaces** — a single task spans multiple applications and windows.
- **Long horizons** — read → judge → act → follow up → recover. It is never one button click.
- **Tacit experience** — the real know-how lives in every judgment a senior operator makes, not in any document.

Large language models solved *thinking* and *speaking*. They have **not** yet solved *learning the job* and *doing it well*. 财听猫 is the desktop runtime that closes that gap — an agent that **sees** any interface, **thinks** in context, **acts** like a human operator, and **learns** from every execution.

---

## ✦ How It Works — See · Think · Do · Learn

    DO --> LEARN["📚 Learn<br/>Write a structured work-trace"]
    LEARN -. compounds into memory .-> THINK
```

| Stage | What happens |
| :-- | :-- |
| **See** | A vision model understands any software UI and its current state. |
| **Think** | The agent plans using context and history to decide *what to do*. |
| **Do** | It clicks, types, switches windows, sends, and records — exactly like a human operator. |
| **Learn** | Every execution is written as a structured **work-trace**, building durable working memory. |

> This is not an app. It is a **working memory engine** that puts AI on the job.

---

## ✦ The Work Memory Runtime

Every execution becomes **one structured `work-trace`**:

```text
work-trace = {
  timestamp,    # when it happened
  ui_state,     # what the screen looked like
  rationale,    # WHY this decision was made
  action,       # click / type / switch / send
  result        # what happened next
}
```

Continuously written and replayable step by step, the runtime offers **three capabilities ordinary RPA cannot**:

| Capability | Why it matters |
| :-- | :-- |
| 🔁 **Replay** | When something breaks, review every step — down to the decision behind it. |
| 📊 **Eval** | Swap models or versions and compare outcomes consistently. |
| 🧬 **Inherit** | The judgment behind a task is captured once and reused, instead of living only in someone's head. |

> Others record **the steps**. 财听猫 records **why each step was taken**. That is the leap from **RPA** to a true **Agent Runtime**.

Built for real-world, sensitive environments:

- 🔒 **Local-first execution** — work traces stay on the machine by default; data never has to leave.
- 🧾 **Fully auditable** — every action trace can be inspected end to end.
- 🔄 **Model-agnostic** — adapts to vision LLMs and is switchable across providers.

---

## ✦ Core Capabilities

From WeChat and WeCom to **any desktop software**, 财听猫 lets AI work where there is **no API**.

- **Universal Vision-Based RPA** — No fragile webhooks or private protocols. 财听猫 behaves like a human user: reading chat bubbles, manipulating inputs, and navigating native UIs through abstract visual recognition.
- **State-of-the-Art Vision** — A unified vision layer extracts unread notification dots, message lists, and chat-bubble text in real time across complex, dynamic layouts.
- **Agentic Workspaces** — Turn unstructured chat requests into actionable node-workflows and API calls, fully programmable via local AI.
- **AI Customer-Service Workbench** — Turn 财听猫 into a full AI customer-service agent with four built-in capabilities:
  - 🎭 **Personas** — switch between ready-made roles (medical expert, butler, sports coach, psychologist, sales consultant) or define your own; the persona drives the reply's system prompt.
  - 📚 **Knowledge Base** — maintain Q&A entries (single or batch import); enabled entries are injected into every reply so answers follow your business facts.
  - 🧠 **Per-Customer Long-Term Memory** — each contact gets an auto-created profile; every conversation is summarized and remembered, and the history is injected back into the next reply.
  - 🏷 **Customer Tags & Categories** — tag, categorize, and annotate customers (VIP / prospect / agent …) with stats and tag filters, all stored locally.
  - 🧩 **Multi-Provider Chat Models** — the built-in chat provider accepts any OpenAI-compatible endpoint: pick a preset (Doubao, GPT-4o, GLM-4V, Qwen-VL) or enter your own Base URL / model / API key.

## 🚀 Getting Started

财听猫 Desktop Agent is a cross-platform client built on **Electron · electron-vite · React · TypeScript**, driven by a Vision-Language Model (VLM).

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (LTS) and npm.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

> On first launch, pick your **target application** and complete the region selection, then open **Settings** to enter your API key and confirm the active Provider.

### 3. Build a release

```bash
npm run build:win     # Windows
npm run build:mac     # macOS
npm run build:linux   # Linux
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Desktop configuration has two layers:

- **Base configuration** — a Volcengine Ark API key powering visual grounding and the built-in Doubao agent.
- **Agent / Provider** — the provider responsible for chat analysis and reply generation.

### What the key is used for

1. **Smart replies** — the model analyzes chat-window screenshots and generates natural responses (with an anti-self-loop guard).
2. **VLM visual grounding** — from a screenshot and a prompt, the model locates on-screen UI controls and returns click coordinates, driving a pure-vision RPA flow.

### Steps

1. Open [Volcengine Console → Ark](https://console.volcengine.com/ark), enable the service, and generate your API key.
2. Launch the app and click the settings button at the bottom-right of the main window.
3. Under **Base configuration**, enter the API key. The default Base URL `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3` rarely needs changing.
4. Under **Agent**, select the active Provider. The built-in default is **Doubao Seed** (`doubao-seed-2-0-lite-260215`).

### Target applications & selection mode

The main window offers a **Target Application** shortcut that decides how the desktop client measures the chat-window layout:

- **WeChat** and **WeCom** use VLM auto-detection of the window region by default.
- **DingTalk, Feishu, Slack, Telegram**, and other desktop apps default to **manual selection**.
- When manual selection is required, click **Start Selection** and outline three regions in order: the **conversation list**, the **chat content area**, and the **input box**.
- Selections are saved locally per target application and reused on subsequent launches; you can re-select at any time.

> VLM vs. manual selection only affects *how layout is measured*. Runtime screenshots, content analysis, reply generation, and message sending all consume the same layout result.

### Provider Hub

财听猫 abstracts "analyze a screenshot and generate a reply" into an independent **Provider**. A provider declares its config schema via `manifest.json` and, through its bundle entry, receives a chat screenshot and returns `reply_text`, `skip`, and `error` events.

- The candidate list is fetched by default from `https://github.com/x18677770772-png/richcat-desktop-agent/provider-hub.json`.
- The hub only tracks each provider's `manifestUrl`; UI fields come from each provider's manifest.
- Results are cached locally after first load; the local cache is preferred unless you refresh via the button next to the Agent title.
- **Doubao Seed** is always retained locally as the default provider, so there is always an option if the remote list is unavailable.

External provider integration is documented in the [Chat Provider docs](./docs/provider.md). A Doubao / Volcengine Ark sample remains in the repo for reference:

```text
resources/providers/volcengine-ark/manifest.json
resources/providers/volcengine-ark/provider.bundle.js
```

> **Recommended dev setup:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

## 🔐 Security & Data Ownership

财听猫's work traces are stored **locally by default** — never uploaded to any server, never included in any public training dataset. Open-source code does **not** mean open data: **your work data always belongs to you.**
